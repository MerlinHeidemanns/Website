My name is Merlin Heidemanns and I am currently a Ph.D candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. My research focuses on applied Bayesian modeling especially in the context of election forecasting, public opinion, and survey research. I am specifically interested in applications in which available data is limited and which necessitate creative solutions that combines auxiliary knowledge about the data with iterative model development and testing to get the most out of the available data. I mainly work in Stan through R.

When I am not looking at parameter output I enjoy visiting art galleries -- trying to see as many Feiningers in person as possible -- as well as backpacking.

This page contains will eventually contain a series of links to related case studies.
